            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Before getting into git, it’s important to understand the background on the tools of version control. Version control is a very useful tool because with a VCS, you can keep every version of a file. You can also revert the files back to its previous or original state. The changes you make can be compared and you can also see who made changes, especially if it’s something that is causing a problem. With VCS, you don’t have to be afraid to make mistakes or changes because you can easily recover files and/or previous states. It would be very wise for graphic or web designers to use a Version Control System.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was created in 2005. It is a version control system that is used for tracking changes in files. It also gives you the ability to coordinate work on these files amongst multiple people. With a VCS, you can keep track of all changes in any file. A git directory on a computer is a repository. Git is a free version control system that is designed to handle small and large products with high speed and efficiency. The way git stores data can be compared to snapshots, meaning that when you make changes or when you commit your project, git takes a snapshot (a picture) of what all your files look like at the moment.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands are very useful to know because this is how groups of people are allowed to work on the same documents at the same time. Although they will be simultaneously working on these documents, they will do so without stepping on each others toes. You enter commands in the terminal prompt. Some of the basic git commands include git init, git add –all, git commit –am ‘initial commit’, git log, git status, etc. The three basic steps are add, commit and push. At first, I was a bit confused by the commands but once you start experimenting, it makes sense.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository, such as Cloud9, is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. You can create a local repository by creating a new repository or cloning an existing remote repository onto your local machine. You use the command pull to get information from the remote repository and you use the command push to send it back to the remote repository. Git is a distributed version control system and your local repository has the same features and functionality as any other git repository. What’s great about this is you can commit, branch and more on your own repository on your local machine/device even without internet access. Once you establish connection again, you can push your changes to any other git repository you have access to.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository, such as GitHub, is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members and can be accessed by anyone at any time. In order for changes to be sent to a remote repository, you must push them. You would send these changes to back them up, make them available to other members of your team or publish them. The purpose of the remote repository is to publish your code to the world and allow them to read or write it. The commands that involve the remote repository are git push and git pull. </p>
